I'm a research assistant in statistics within the [ULTRA](https://clinical-research.centre.uq.edu.au/ultra) team at the University of Queensland (UQ). Welcome to my personal webpage.

My research interests include:
- Bayesian adaptive clinical trials
- Bayesian non-parametric priors and approximations
- Prior elicitation methods
- Causal inference and missing data estimation via DAGs

I'm currently half-way through my [BCA Masters of Biostatistics](https://www.bca.edu.au/course-information/masters-degree/) and aim to hone my skills and continue research after this degree.
